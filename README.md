# CyberGuardX Backend

Welcome to the **CyberGuardX Backend** project! 🚀  
This codebase is designed to teach students the fundamentals of building a backend application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. Along the way, we explored key concepts like routing, controllers, services, and database modeling.

---

## 📚 What We Learned

### 1. **Express Framework**
- How to set up an Express application.
- Creating routes using `express.Router()` for modularity.
- Handling HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for CRUD operations.

### 2. **MongoDB and Mongoose**
- Connecting to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Defining schemas and models for structured data (e.g., `Product` model).
- Performing database operations like `find`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`.

### 3. **MVC Architecture**
- **Model**: Representing data with Mongoose models.
- **Controller**: Handling HTTP requests and delegating logic to services.
- **Service**: Encapsulating business logic and database operations for reusability.

### 4. **Separation of Concerns**
- Keeping the codebase clean and modular by separating routes, controllers, and services.
- Using a service layer to abstract database operations.

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Implementing error handling for database operations and HTTP requests.
- Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (`200`, `404`, `500`) and descriptive error messages.

### 6. **Modern JavaScript Features**
- Using ES Modules (`import/export`) for cleaner code organization.
- Async/Await for handling asynchronous operations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for creating APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB.
- **Joi**: Validation library for request data.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.

## 🧑‍💻 For Students
This project is a great starting point for learning backend development. By working through this codebase, you’ll gain hands-on experience with:
- Building RESTful APIs.
- Structuring a backend application.
- Working with databases and models.
- Writing clean and maintainable code.

---

## 📖 Next Steps
- Add authentication and authorization using **JWT**.
- Implement file uploads for product images using **Multer**.
- Write unit tests for controllers and services.
